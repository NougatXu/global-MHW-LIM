## 1. Introduction

Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are events characterized by prolonged anomalously warm ocean surface or subsurface temperatures (Hobday et al 2016; 2018). By definition, MHWs may be quantified using measures of their intensity and duration; that is, given an intensity and a duration, one can find events that satisfies those criteria and count the total number of events in a time series. The following schematic diagram (adapted from Hobday et al 2016) illustrates the identification of one MHW event.
